## Introduction
Reading is a very good habit that one needs to develop in life. Good books can inform you, enlighten you and lead you in the right direction. There is no better companion than a good book. Reading is important because it is good for your overall well-being. Once you start reading, you experience a whole new world. When you start loving the habit of reading you eventually get addicted to it. Reading develops language skills and vocabulary. Reading books is also a way to relax and reduce stress. It is important to read a good book at least for a few minutes each day to stretch the brain muscles for healthy functioning.Arcypyplus provides you a plethora of book reviews through which you can find the books which suits you the most and expand your imagination beyond the sky.

### **The Project**
In this project,we aim to develop a simple yet useful user friendly website which would guide curious readers to the books they might be interested in,along with the written and video reviews of those books,along with giving them the option to buy and read the book themselves if they like to.
<br>
Books really are your best friends as you can rely on them when you are bored, upset, depressed, lonely or annoyed. They will accompany you anytime you want them and enhance your mood. They share with you information and knowledge any time you need. Good books always guide you to the correct path in life.The objective is to help the readers who have recently started reading books by knowing the various genres they are interested or want to explore,and by providing genuine reviews in order to help them decide the book they want to read.
